## Why Should I Bother Blogging?

When learning something new, there are three [commonly cited](https://www.bitnative.com/2013/12/14/programming-your-brain-the-art-of-learning-in-three-steps/) steps to become an "expert":

1. Watch someone who is an "expert"
2. Learn and practice the topic
3. Teach the topic to others

While most developers can easily say they do steps 1 and 2, step 3 can be intimidating or difficult to complete. If you have trouble speaking in front of people, or if you don't even have people to teach to, it can be discouraging to try and take that last step.

That's where blogging comes in. Having your own blog gives you a platform to teach while lowering the stakes. You don't need to worry about saying something incorrectly or explaining an idea poorly. In fact if you're self-conscious about other people reading it, you can even just publish it to a private repo and use it as practice.

Even if you're "teaching" to no one at first, blogging will help you retain information and get a deeper understanding for topics you know. And if you include a lot of examples, it can even be a personal reference book for topics that you can refer back to.

And if you are more comfortable with sharing what you know, you'll also benefit the people who read it. Every developer has been saved by a good article explaining a complex idea with questionable documentation. So why not try to do the same for someone else?

## Creating a Blog

There are a few good options if you want to start blogging.

One of the more popular options is using [Medium](https://medium.com/), which let's you set up a blog with no programming experience required. The editor is straight-forward, and there's a solid sharing system built into it. It's a great option for beginning developers, although there have been recent criticisms of their pay model, which can limit access to articles.

For more intermediate developers, there are options that require a bit more tweaking but give you much more control.

If you're a frontend developer, you'll find that Gatsby is an extremely popular choice. In fact, there's even a Gatsby ["starter blog"](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) template that gives you everything you need to start writing. Dan Abramov, one of the core maintainers of React, actually used it to [make his own blog.](https://overreacted.io/)

For backend developers, you can quickly spin up a blog using [Ruby on Rails](https://medium.com/@deallen7/ruby-on-rails-app-build-blog-3d9975a999ae) or a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Writing a Blog Post

### 1. Coming Up With An Idea

The best trick I learned from studying English was this: Ideas never come when you're looking for them.

Instead of sitting down in front of your computer and trying to come up with an idea, try to write down notes when you have an idea or solve a difficult bug.

If you learn something new about flexbox, write it down. If you finally figure out how something works in React, write it down. If you find a neat Ruby helper that you didn't know about, write it down.

Even if you don't think you could write a "full" post about the topic, it's good to write all your ideas down and come back to them later. You may have even have 2 or 3 smaller ideas you could combine into one topic, like a "CSS Layout Cheatsheet" or "5 Ruby Methods You Should Know".

### 2. Pick An Audience, Outline Your Topic

Before you start writing, there are two things you should do: Decide who your audience is, and outline your topic.

By determining who you're writing for, you can make sure that you don't overwhelm less experienced developers or feel like you're "talking down" to more senior ones. You want to try and keep this consistent, because there's nothing more frustrating than reading an article that sounds like it's for beginners and then skips over all the difficult parts in the middle because it assumes you already know it.

Even if you are writing for more advanced developers, it's good to try and explain things as you go, or at least link to articles that explain them.

After you've picked an audience, try to outline your topic into several sections. If you're doing a list, write down your "5 Ruby Methods" you're going to teach. If you're teaching a new topic, try to have a section that explains why the new topic is important, then show examples of how it's useful.

It can be easy to skip over the outlining step, but it almost always results in articles that lose focus or get sidetracked because there wasn't a plan from the beginning.

### 3. Start Writing

Once you have your outline finished, you can start expanding on each section and writing the post itself.

As you're writing, try not to get stuck on making each sentence sound perfect. It's much more important to get your ideas written down at the beginning. You can always edit (refactor) your writing later, but first you need to get the ideas out of your head.

In general, you want to avoid long sentences and overly complicated language. Using SAT words doesn't help anyone, and it's almost always a sign of someone trying to seem "impressive" rather than write something that's helpful for others. Always try to keep you writing simple and to the point.

And if you're writing about a programming concept, it's always best to include lots of examples wherever they're relevant.
