  Cratebind Frontend Blog
</h1>

A blog for the frontend developers at Cratebind to share their successes, failures and advice.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone repo**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    git clone git@github.com:cratebind/frontend-blog.git frontend-blog
    ```

1.  **Install Dependencies and Start**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd frontend-blog
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```


## Writing Content

This repo is open to pull requests for new content or site changes.

To create a new post, create a new directory in `content/blog` with the title of your post.

In that folder, add an `index.md` file to start writing your post. Gatsby will automatically update when you save your file so you can see what it'll look like in real time.
